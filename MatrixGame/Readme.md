## LED MATRIX GAME - SNAKE
<hr>
<br/>**The game**<br/>
It's the classic Snake that we all know and love. You will have to control the movement of a snake in order to make him reach the food that will make its length increase after he eats it but make sure not to hit your body after getting to a great lenth. Also in more difficult scenarios you will have to make sure that he will not hit any walls because otherwise he will die and the game will be over.<br/>
<br/>**How to play**<br/>
You will start from the center of the 8x8 LED matrix.<br>
There will be 4 types of movement up, down, left or right done with the help of the joystick. If you want to make the snake eat the food you will have to direct its head to a led that blinks (it marks the food spot). You will have to be quick because the food spot will vanish after some seconds.<br/>
<br/>**Other specifications**<br/>
  - will have a score that will increase when you get to a food spot<br>
  - as the time passes you speed on the matrix will increase
  - there will me more maps to choose from
  - it will be a time pressure to get to the food spot
  - maybe more lives
  - the hight score will be saved on EEPROM
